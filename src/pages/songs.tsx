      <Typography>
        Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
        <br />That saved a wretch like me.
        <br />I once was lost, but now am found,
        <br />Was blind, but now I see.
        <br />
        <br />Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
        <br />And grace my fears relieved.
        <br />How precious did that grace appear
        <br />The hour I first believed.
        <br />
        <br />Through many dangers, toils and snares
        <br />I have already come;
        <br />Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
        <br />And grace will lead me home.
        <br />
        <br />The Lord has promised good to me
        <br />His word my hope secures;
        <br />He will my shield and portion be,
        <br />As long as life endures.
        <br />
        <br />Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
        <br />and mortal life shall cease,
        <br />I shall possess within the veil,
        <br />A life of joy and peace.
        <br />
        <br />When we&apos;ve been there ten thousand years
        <br />Bright shining as the sun,
        <br />We&apos;ve no less days to sing God&apos;s praise
        <br />Than when we&apos;ve first begun.

      <Typography>
        Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
        <br /> You have been so, so good to me
        <br /> Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
        <br /> You have been so so kind to me
        <br />
        <br />Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
        <br /> Oh, it chases me down, fights &apos;til I&apos;m found, leaves the 99
        <br /> And I couldn&apos;t earn it
        <br /> I don&apos;t deserve it, still You give yourself away
        <br /> Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
        <br />
        <br />When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
        <br /> You have been so, so good to me
        <br /> When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
        <br /> You have been so, so kind to me
        <br />
        <br />There&apos;s no shadow You won&apos;t light up
        <br /> Mountain You won&apos;t climb up
        <br /> Coming after me
        <br /> There&apos;s no wall You won&apos;t kick down
        <br /> Lie You won&apos;t tear down
        <br /> Coming after me

      <Typography>
I raise a hallelujah, in the presence of my enemies
        <br /> I raise a hallelujah, louder than the unbelief
        <br /> I raise a hallelujah, my weapon is a melody
        <br /> I raise a hallelujah, heaven comes to fight for me
        <br />
        <br />I&apos;m gonna sing in the middle of the storm
        <br /> Louder and louder, you&apos;re gonna hear my praises roar
        <br /> Up from the ashes hope will arise
        <br /> Death is defeated, the King is alive
        <br />
        <br />I raise a hallelujah, with everything inside of me
        <br /> I raise a hallelujah, I will watch the darkness flee
        <br /> I raise a hallelujah, in the middle of the mystery
        <br /> I raise a hallelujah, fear, you lost your hold on me
        <br />
        <br />Sing a little louder - In the presence of my enemies
        <br />Sing a little louder - Louder than the unbelief
        <br />Sing a little louder - My weapon is a melody
        <br />Sing a little louder - Heaven comes to fight for me

        <br />I raise a hallelujah (hallelujah)
        <br />I raise a hallelujah (I raise my hallelujah)
